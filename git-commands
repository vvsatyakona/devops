1. Git clone
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

There are a couple of ways to download the source code, but mostly I prefer the clone with https way:

git clone <https://name-of-the-repository-link>
For example, if we want to download a project from Github, all we need to do is click on the green button (clone or download), copy the URL in the box and paste it after the git clone command that I've shown right above.

This will make a copy of the project to your local workspace so you can start working with it.

2. Git branch
Branches are highly important in the git world. By using branches, several developers are able to work in parallel on the same project simultaneously. We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.

Creating a new branch:

git branch <branch-name>
This command will create a branch locally. To push the new branch into the remote repository, you need to use the following command:

git push -u <remote> <branch-name>
